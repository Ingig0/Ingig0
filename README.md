First person 3D platformer Ã  la the movement focused gamemodes and mods of the Quake series and Source Engine games. Featuring bunnyhopping, rocket jumping, surfing, and more. 

I'm the sole creator of this game and have made the player controller, weapon functionality, UI, levels, and backend systems such as saving level run data and viewing it, saving settings, and creating the entities to be used to make levels using the Qodot plugin.

This is my first ever Godot game and as such presented many challenges in learning the engine, the biggest challenge being understanding the way it does transforms. However, learning the engine isn't much of a problem, the biggest problem is getting the time and motivation to work on the game.

An RTS where you control dirt creatures called loamlings and are tasked with stopping a mudskipper infestation threatening the local village.
I was the primary gameplay programmer and pseudo-project lead. I focussed on the player controls, interactions with buildings and enemy behavior.
The biggest struggle was making the unit selection and movement to a level that I was satisfied with, that ended up taking up the bulk of my time.

A simple SHMUP where your goal is to survive two minutes against a never ending onsluaght of enemies.
I was the programmer and designer for this game and my goal for it was to destil the essence of an action game into as small of a package as I could.
I think I succeded in the regard but other aspects are lacking, the game is way to for how casual it's supposed to be and the player movement feels too sluggish and linear.
